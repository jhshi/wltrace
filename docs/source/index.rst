Welcome to WlTrace's documentation!
===================================

WlTrace (Wireless Trace) is a Python library that can parse Pcap or Peektagged
packet traces. As the name suggests, the main focus is wireless, 802.11 (Wifi)
in particular, packet traces.

WlTrace provides a simple abstraction of packet traces, and does all the
heavy-lifting behind the scene so that one can focus on more interesting tasks
beyond the (tedious) parsing step.
